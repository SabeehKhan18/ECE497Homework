This javascript program implements hw03.

The assignment description is here: bit.ly/bone03

etch-sketch uses the adafruit 8x8 bicolor led matrix. 
i2c_tmp101 gets temperature data from the tmp101 sensors and uses bonescript to set interrupts on the alert pins on the temperature sensors. It is programmed so that if the temperature changes by 2 degrees, the interrupts are detected and the program exits.
