One part of the assignment is to edit a web interface to control the red and orange leds on the adafruit 8x8 i2c led matrix. All i did was edit ledmatrix.js in the realtime folder. I have plans to customize the ledmatrix.html and ledmatrix.css. To start the service, execute boneServer.js first. 

The second part of the assignment is to create a memory map and use that to control a button and led on the beaglebone black.
